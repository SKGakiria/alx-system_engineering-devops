Tasks
0. Change your home IP

Write a Bash script that configures an Ubuntu server with the below:

Requirements:

localhost resolves to 127.0.0.2
facebook.com resolves to 8.8.8.8.
The checker is running on Docker

If running this script on a machine that you’ll continue to use,
be sure to revert localhost to 127.0.0.1. Otherwise, a lot of things
will stop working!

1. Show attached IPs

Write a Bash script displaying all active IPv4 IPs on the machine
it’s executed on.

2. Port listening on localhost

Write a Bash script listening on port 98 on localhost.
