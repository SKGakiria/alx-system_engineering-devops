EXPLANATION

1. The user types the domain name www.foobar.com into the web browser
2. The browser then sends a request to the router
3. The router passes the message to the DNS server.
The DNS server implements the A record type and maps the domain name www.foobar.com to the IP address 8.8.8.8
4. The DNS server then sends a response message to the router.
5. The router then passes the message to the browser with the requested IP address.
6.The browser then sends a request for the website to the server.
7. In the server the web server sends a HTTP request to the application server.
8. The application server interprets the request and forms a query depending on the requested data by the user and sends this to the database.
9. The database then sends a response of the requested information
10. The application server then formulates a HTML version of the request that can be viewed by the browser.
11. This is sent as a HTTP response to the web server which then serves the web page back to the router.

ISSUES WITH THE CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE

1. The current system has multiple single points of failure (SPOF)for example having only one server means that when the server fails the whole system fails.
2. Lack of a load balancer in the current infrastructure also means that control of traffic to the server is very inefficient.
3. Also during repair due to lack of redundancy, the whole system has to be shut down until the repair is complete.
